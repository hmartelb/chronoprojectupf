# Arduino-based wireless chronometer
Arduino implementation of an infra-red wireless chronometer for the course Sensors and Data Aquisition, Bachelor's Degree in Audiovisual Telecommunication Systems Engineering at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). 

The chronometer system consists of two nodes, one acting as master and one acting as slave. The time keeping and displaying is performed by the master, and the slave sends information updates to the master over a wireless channel.
